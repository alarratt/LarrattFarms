## Where I Went

This evening I spent some time on a few things:
1. I will be sticking with Astro over 11ty or other SSGs/tools. There are a few reasons for this: 
    1. I already have a decent amount of time working with and setting up Astro stuff.
    2. Yes, 11ty is simpler, but I want the collections specifically in Astro. This might be one of those situations where I don't know what I don't know though, if I am being honest
    3. Astro is more flexible/scalable. From what I read, setting up interactivity in 11ty is more intensive, and while I may not be there yet, it is likely I will be at some point in the future.
2. Understanding content collections better. In all honesty, this was more because of the upgrade from 4 to 5, but I learned it nonetheless. Maybe tomorrow I can implement it and have 2 collections: 1 for the "blog" that was setup in the tutorial, and one for this content. That way, I can build my actual blog with multiple categories. One for farm stuff, one for AI stuff, and one for, well, who knows. 

## Where I Want to Go

I think AI could end up being really big... even compared to where it is today. Trump just announced a huge investment in it nationally, and if there's room for me to make my living, I think I can do it in that space. Just exactly how is not clear at this point in time.
